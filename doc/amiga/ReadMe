Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to SimpleMail  an  email  program  for  your  Amiga.  The
program  and  the usage is very similar to to YAM's (although YAM
is actually much more powerful) but it has (or should  get)  some
features  which  YAM doesn't offer. Note that this is really only
an alpha version, so don't expect too much of it at  this  stage.
It  is  really very limited. The source of SimpleMail is open and
released under the GNU Public license. Look at the bottom how  to
obtain it.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleMail requires OS3.0 and MUI 3.8.
It also needs some additional MUI Custom Classes:

 BetterString - http://www.p2p-it.dk/duff/MCC_BetterString.LZX
 NList - http://www.aphaso.de/download/MCC_NList0_90.lha
 NListtree - http://www.aphaso.de/download/MCC_NListtree18.7.lha
 TextEditor - http://www.p2p-it.dk/duff/MCC_TextEditor.LZX

Ensure  that  you  always  have  the  latest  versions installed.

Usage
~~~~~
Just double click the SimpleMail icon and if  your  machine  fits
the  requirements  you  should  see  the  main  window. Press the
"Config" button to configure important things of SimpleMail (smtp
and  pop3  servers). If you are familiar with YAM it should be no
problem.
