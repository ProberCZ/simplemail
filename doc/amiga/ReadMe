Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to SimpleMail, an email client for your Amiga. The GUI and
the usage are very similar to YAM's (although YAM is currently much
more powerful), but it has (or should  get) some features which YAM
doesn't offer. Please note this is BETA software. SimpleMail is
Open Source and released under the GNU Public License. Look at the
bottom of this file to see how to obtain the sources or get CVS access.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleMail requires OS3.0 and MUI 3.8.
It also needs some additional MUI Custom Classes:

 BetterString - http://www.p2p-it.dk/duff/MCC_BetterString.LZX
 NList - http://www.aphaso.de/download/MCC_NList0_90.lha
 NListtree - http://www.aphaso.de/download/MCC_NListtree18.8.lha
 PopPlaceholder - ftp://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/dev/mui/MCC_Popph.lha
 TextEditor - http://www.p2p-it.dk/duff/MCC_TextEditor.LZX

Make sure that you always have the latest versions installed!

Changes since 0.14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- internally most strings are utf8 now. Note: Maybe I missed
  some utf8 to iso conversion and you will see some text bugs
- user can select the charset now which he uses on his system
- some new translations
- two new columns in the maillist: "POP3 Server", "Received"
  (Pop3 Server only has values on new mails)
- slight layout change of the compose window
- supports "Content-Description:" field
- bug fixes as usual
