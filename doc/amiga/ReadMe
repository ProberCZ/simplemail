Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to SimpleMail  an  email  program  for  your  Amiga.  The
program  and  the usage is very similar to to YAM's (although YAM
is actually much more powerful) but it has (or should  get)  some
features  which  YAM doesn't offer. Note that this is really only
an alpha version, so don't expect too much of it at  this  stage.
The source of SimpleMail is open and released under the GNU Public
license. Look at the bottom how to obtain it.
