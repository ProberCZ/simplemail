<p>
    Welcome to the support page of SimpleMail!
</p>
<p>
    SimpleMail is a new mailer for the <A href="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga</A>
    classic platform but it is intended to be as portable as possible so there
    speaks nothing against a <A href="http://www.morphos.de/">MorphOS</A> or
    even Windows version.
</p>
<p>
    In the current state, SimpleMail is an alpha version but it is very stable
    however as we try to implement every feature so that it works and go then
    on to the next one. However, SimpleMail grows very fast and with the help
    of you it can overgrow YAM soon.
</p>
<p>
    You will always find the latest versions (which are not necessarily
    placed in the AMINET) here. Here is also a <A href="index.html?part=faq">
    FAQ</A>, please read it carefuly!
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions or bugs then send them to the user-mailinglist
    please, whose URL you'll find in the <A href="index.html?part=links">links</A>.
    But if you have any encouragements so send them to one of the main
    developers. You can find their e-mail addresses in
    <A href="index.html?part=contact">contact</A>.
