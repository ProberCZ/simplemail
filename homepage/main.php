<p>
  SimpleMail is a new mailer for the <a
  href="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga</a> classic platform but it is
  intended to be as portable as possible so there speaks nothing
  against a <a href="http://www.morphos.de/">MorphOS</a> or even <a
  href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows</a> version.
</p>

<p>
  In the current state, SimpleMail is an alpha version but it is
  very stable however as we try to implement every feature so that
  it works and go then on to the next one. However, SimpleMail
  grows very fast and with your help it can overgrow <a
  href="http://www.yam.ch/">YAM</a> soon.
</p>

<p>
  You will always find the latest versions (which are not
  necessarily placed in the <a
  href="http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminet/">AMINET</a>) here. Here is
  also a <a href="index.php?body=faq">FAQ</a>, please read it carefuly!
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions or bugs then send them to the
  user-mailinglist please, whose URL you'll find in the <a
  href="index.php?body=links">links</a>. Bug reports should submitted to the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=115322&group_id=15322&func=browse">
  Bug Tracking system</A>. But if you have encouragements so send them to one of the main developers. You
  can find our e-mail addresses in <a href="index.php?body=contact">contact</a>.
