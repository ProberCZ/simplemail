<p>
  SimpleMail is a new mailer for the <a
  href="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga</a> platform (both classic and OS4) and compatible systems
  (<a href="http://www.morphos.de/">MorphOS</a>). 
  It is intended to be as portable as possible so there speaks nothing
  against a version for other systems, like for example <A
  href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In the current state, SimpleMail is an beta version but it is
  very stable however as we try to implement every feature so that
  it works and go then on to the next one. However, SimpleMail
  grows very fast and with your help it can overgrow <a
  href="http://www.yam.ch/">YAM</a> soon.
</p>

<p>
  You will always find the latest versions (which are not
  necessarily placed in the <a
  href="http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminet/">AMINET</a>) here. Here is
  also a <a href="index.php?body=faq">FAQ</a>, please read it carefuly!
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions or bugs then send them to the
  user-mailinglist please, whose URL you'll find in the <a
  href="index.php?body=links">links</a>. Bug reports should submitted to the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=115322&group_id=15322&func=browse">
  Bug Tracking system</A>.
</p>
<p>
 But if you have encouragements send them to one of the developers. Their e-mail addressed can be found in
 <a href="index.php?body=contact">contact</a>. And actually, if you
 like SimpleMail that much, it is possible to express your encouragements by donating some money to our Paypal
 account. In order to do so, use the paypal button at the footer of these pages and then process the instructions.
 However, every feedback is much appreciated!
