            <b>Q</b>: Why do you write a completly new mailer and don't simply take part
            on the YAM development as YAM is under GPL?<br>
        </FONT>
        <br>
        <FONT color="black">
            <b>A</b>: Because when we started developing SimpleMail, YAM wasn't under GPL
            and no one knew if it ever will be. As we are both students of computer
            sciences we decided to write our own mailer to gain some practice and
            that's the reason why we are still developing it on. An other reason is
            that it would probably be more work to rewrite YAM than to write our own
            mailer. And last but not least, it's fun to code and to create something
            new and own.<br>

        <FONT color="black">
            <b>A</b>: Yes, SimpleMail will have all the functions that YAM has but
            less bugs and many new features you have missed.<br>

        <FONT color="black">
            <b>A</b>: Rather not as we think that it is better to make two seperate
            programs, because adding news would be too much ballast for users that
            don't want it. Wait for SimpleNews instead. ;)<br>

        <br>
        <FONT color="black">
            <b>A</b>: We think that the sourcecode of SimpleMail is quite portable
            and so it should be no problem to port it. But we cannot do everything
            so when SimpleMail has left the alpha/beta stage, feel free to contact
            us if you want to port it to your favorite platform.<br>
