SimpleMail
==========

SimpleMail is a simple email client targeting AmigaOS (both the classic OS 3.1 and OS 4.x)
and compatible platforms such as AROS and MorphOS.

Download
--------

You can download binaries from http://simplemail.sourceforge.net/index.php?body=downloads.
MorphOS users may also check SimpleMail-MOS at https://code.google.com/p/simplemail-mos/.
This was a fork of SimpleMail focusing on MorphOS, which, however, is discontinued.
